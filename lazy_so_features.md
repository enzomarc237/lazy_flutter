# Lazy.so: Features

Based on information from its website and various reviews, here are the key features of Lazy.so:

**Core Capture & Input:**

*   **Universal Quick Capture:** A primary feature, allowing users to capture information from any active application on their Mac using a single keyboard shortcut (typically `Command+L`).
*   **Versatile Content Clipping:**
    *   Notes & Ideas: Jot down thoughts instantly.
    *   Links/URLs: Save web pages.
    *   Articles: Clip full articles, even from behind paywalls, for later reading and highlighting.
    *   Twitter Threads: Save entire threads, potentially even if the original tweet is deleted.
    *   YouTube Videos: Capture key points and take notes alongside videos.
    *   Newsletters/Emails: Save newsletter content directly without forwarding; captures author details and provides backlinks to the original email (e.g., in Apple Mail).
    *   Kindle Highlights: Automatic syncing of Kindle highlights and notes.
    *   Images: Capture images (though some limitations noted, e.g., with Apple Mail).

**Organization & Management:**

*   **Universal Inbox:** A central place for all captured items ("Cards").
*   **Nested Notes & Tasks:** Ability to create hierarchical structures by nesting notes and tasks within each other, similar to Notion's pages.

*   **Pinboard:** A space to store shortcuts to frequently accessed notes/cards.
*   **Filters:** View specific cards based on attributes like type (Note vs. Task) or content (e.g., video, emails).
*   **People Database:** Automatically tries to identify and add people associated with captured content (e.g., email sender).
*   **Sources Attribute:** Tracks where information was captured from.
*   **Events and Locations:** Planned attributes (coming soon as of late 2023/early 2024 reviews).
